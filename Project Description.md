# About this Iris Flower Classificatoin 
### This is a basic ML Project to Classify Iris flowers of 3 species(Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on it's Sepal and Petal size using K-nearest Neighbor algorithm which is supervised algorithm which falls under classification 
### this algorithm checks the species sizes and predicts to which specie it belongs to by training and testing from Iris dataset
### I used the dataset from University of California Irvine here is the link below
